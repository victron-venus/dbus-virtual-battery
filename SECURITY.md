## Security Considerations

This project runs on Venus OS with access to:

- MQTT broker (battery data)
- D-Bus (Victron system)

### Recommendations

1. **MQTT**: Use authentication on your MQTT broker
2. **Network**: Run on a trusted local network
3. **Firewall**: Restrict MQTT port (1883) access

## Known Limitations

- MQTT connection without TLS by default
- Designed for trusted home networks only
